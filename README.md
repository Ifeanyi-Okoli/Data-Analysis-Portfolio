# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
Analyzed customer churn for a telecom company using a publicly available dataset to identify factors influencing retention.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab (or Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Findings
- Customers who churn have shorter tenure (median ~10 months) compared to non-churning customers (~40 months).
- MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges show moderate correlation, suggesting higher charges relate to longer tenure.
- ~26% churn rate, indicating a significant retention challenge.
